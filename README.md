Second question

I demo an API test using Robote Framework Selenium with some random informations. Limited the scoop to POST.

Third question

I craeted some basic automated test using Robot-Framework and also Cypress, due the the time constraint, i sent an email about broken functionality 
of the HR Modal managerial login, so i wasnt sure if the time for the task would be extended hence, tested with employee only.

Bug - The modal does not allow user to pick dates in the present year 2023.  Automated tested i selected dates from 2022 as an employee.
